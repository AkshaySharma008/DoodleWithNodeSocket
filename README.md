In this Application , I have created a very basic app in which we can do live sketching/doodling
in same network.

If you want to try this , then simply follow the below steps:
####  1. Clone Repository
``` git clone https://github.com/AkshaySharma008/DoodleWithNodeSocket.git ```

####  2. Install Dependencies
  - Open terminal at the folder location and install dependencies using command
``` npm install  ```

####  3. Run
  - After Installing dependencies , simply run the below command in terminal
``` npm start  ```

#### 4. How to work in live mode
  - If you are connected with you mobile phone's Wifi Network , then simply open the IP Address at port 3000 in your mobile as well as in PC.
  You will see the magic xd.
  - If you are with certain broadband connection , then simple use its IP address at port 3000.
  - eg. 192.168.43.220:3000

#### Note: This is very first time , I have worked with Socket IO and tried something to work in live mode. Give it a Star if you like it.
